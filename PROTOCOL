0) cp *.com PATHTOTHENUMBERED/.
copy the content of the verifiedNUSprocBruker folder into the numbered directory of the experiment you want to process
1) ./bruker (in the numbered directory to generate fid.com specific to your data)
  a) in the middle section select "During Processing (Better Baseline)" for the Digital Oversampling Correction
  b) for chemical shift calibration select "From O1/BF1"
  c) click [Read Parameters] again
  d) Set Acquisition mode in indirect dimensions (y,z-axis) to Real
  e) save the script as fid.com

2) open the fid.com in a text editor
     a) remove all references to nus at the top - keep the first line with
        #!/bin/csh, and keep everything following bruk2pipe
     b) in the bruk2pipe line, change ./ser_full to ./ser
     c) change yN and yT to 4 
     d) change zN and zT to the # of sampled points (should be length of schedule)
	(if you forgot, the first number when you run "wc NUSLISTFILENAME" is the length of 	   your schedule)
     e) remove the xyz2pipe line and everything after it
     f) For standard triple resonance spectra, the N dimension is collected with ECHO/ANTIECHO. If so, you probably need to erase also the -out line and write the following:
        | nmrPipe -fn MAC -macro $NMRTXT/ranceY.M -noRd -noWr   \
        | pipe2xyz -x -out ./fid/test%03d.fid -verb -ov -to 0
     g) save fid.com 
3) ./fid.com
   a) note that if you have an incomplete dataset it will give an error that tells you something about what number you should actually put for zN
4) ./ft1.com 
	Follow the directions in the console to correct the phase in the first dimension 		(and the extraction -optional-). In nmrDraw look with h at the 1st line and find the 		right p0.
		"Press any key to continue to check phasing with nmrDraw.
		If you change the phase, rerun ft1.com to check again.
		Otherwise, correct the phase in the reconstruct.com
		also consider correcting the EXT extraction in the same way
		and then run reconstruct.com."
5) ./reconstruct.com
6) open f23.com in a text editor and change the name of the .ucsf to your experiment name
7) ./ft23.com   then check results with nmrDraw HN.15N.dat or nmrDraw HN.13C.dat
   a) If your HN.15N.dat looks like it was split in half and pasted together upside down, you should try FT -alt -verb instead of FT -auto
   b) Check whether you need to uncomment the REV line, especially in N dimension, since the HN.15N.dat plane should match your HSQC
   c) If your HN.15N.dat looks whole but like a second copy was pasted on top upside down, go back to the fid.com and make sure you have the RanceY line just before the last line.
   d) Similar considerations apply to the HN.13C.dat plane.
8) you can remove xyz, yzx, yzx_ist, fid, rec directories
